If I should stay
I should only be in your way
So I'll go but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

And I will always love you
I will always love you
You
My darling, you

Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So good-bye
Please don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need
